# Filterpolish
[work in progress] This is a small tool that works with .filter files. It reads them into memory and rebuilds them, while optimizing the structure. It also provides a small set of tools for creating automatic subversions. The syntax can be adapted for other similar markup languages or rule-based systems. Currently it only works with PoE. filter files.
